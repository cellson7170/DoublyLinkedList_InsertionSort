# DoublyLinkedList_InsertionSort
/** An implementation of Insertion Sort on a Doubly-Linked List, 
 * which takes input from the user to decide the length of said 
 * list, creates a list of random numbers, and then sorts the list 
 * using insertion sort. The sorted list is then printed to the 
 * console, along with the time taken to sort the list, to the 
 * nearest millisecond. NOTE: Any list over 100,000 elements long 
 * may take quite a while to sort.
